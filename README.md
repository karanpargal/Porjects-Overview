 <h3><u><strong><i>Sigma Start</i></strong></u> &nbsp;(EVM)</h3>
<hr />

Use SigmaStart to kickstart your projects and ideas and bring them to life where anyone can invest a part of their income in the ideas/projects ranging from a common man to business tycoon, and that too on a recurring basis. This alienates the necessity of investing in one-go and provides flexiblity to users as well. At any point of time, if the investor feels that the idea/project hasn't met their expectations, they have the option of discontinuing the recurring investment as well.
